### **Extended Experimental Plan**

**1. Research Question**

Research Question: How can sensor technology be collaboratively used with DJs in a Club to enhance the audience's user experience?

**2. Methods**

*Equipment:*

We will employ state-of-the-art wearable sensors, including heart rate monitors and motion intensity trackers, coupled with advanced camera technology. These tools will allow us to comprehensively monitor participants' actions, physiological responses, and environmental interactions during creative performances.

*Conditions:*

- **Control Condition:** The DJ performs music without integrating sensor technology.
- **Test Condition:** The DJ incorporates sensor technology, with the audience wearing these devices, enabling real-time feedback on the audience's state to the DJ.

*Measurements:*

We will meticulously measure the following dependent variables:

1. **Efficiency and Time Utilization of the Music Performance:** Analyzing the time and interaction frequency of the audience in response to various musical elements.
2. **Physiological Indicators of Participants:** Monitoring heart rate and motion intensity to gauge the audience's excitement during the music performance.
3. **User Experience Feedback from Participants:** Employing a combination of questionnaire surveys and real-time interactions to gain insights into the audience's subjective feelings about the music performance.

*Procedure:*

In the test condition, participants will be instructed to don wearable sensor devices and engage with camera technology throughout the performance. The sensors will capture physiological data and motion information from the audience, while the camera will document their expressions and interactions. The DJ will dynamically adjust the intensity of the music performance in real-time based on the collected information.

*Participants:*

Our recruitment strategy will target a diverse group of 25 participants aged between 18-40, reached through social media, Club promotions, and music enthusiast communities. We will ensure diversity in participant gender and music preferences to enhance the universality of our findings.

**3. Results**

*Hypotheses to be Tested:*

Our hypotheses revolve around the belief that in the test condition, the DJ's integration of sensor data will result in playing soothing music during periods of audience fatigue and energetic music during moments of excitement. Consequently, we anticipate the audience exhibiting a higher frequency of music interaction, increased engagement, and an overall more positive user experience.

*Charts and Statistical Tests:*

To present our findings, we will employ detailed line charts comparing audience engagement and music performance effects between the control and test conditions. Statistical tests, including t-tests or ANOVA, will be utilized to determine the significance of observed differences.

**4. Discussion**

*Confounding Variables and Experimental Errors:*

Acknowledging potential confounding variables such as individual differences, music preferences, and environmental factors, our analysis will diligently control for these variables. Randomizing group assignments will further mitigate the impact of confounding variables.

*Balancing Internal and External Validity:*

Striking a balance between internal validity and external validity, we commit to maintaining consistency in factors such as DJ performance, musical content, lighting, and environment during experimental conditions. To bolster external validity, participant recruitment and experimental settings will align with the authentic context of a Club.

*Ethical Considerations:*

We are committed to upholding the highest ethical standards. Privacy and anonymity of sensor data will be strictly maintained. Participants will be comprehensively informed about the experiment's purpose, the nature of the information they will receive, and the voluntary nature of their participation. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and the experimental plan will undergo thorough review by the ethics committee, ensuring ethical integrity throughout the research.
