# STEM for Creatives Assignment 3

## Audio Visualisation 

Take either Task 1 (wave form visualiser) or Task 2 (FFT visualiser) from the Week 5 lab and continue to develop your sketch further. 

The expectation here is that you are able to show you understand how to use the ``Animator.py`` package to draw and move shapes, that you understand that for both of these tasks, you have some ordered information (either by time (task 1) or by frequency bin (task 2)), and that this information takes on different values (amplitudes for tasks, bin values for task 2). 

You must decide how to map this information along these two axes to provide a visual accompaniment to the music. You main focus isn't an accurate representation of all of the information (e.g. like a traditional graph), but a creative mapping of the information available as it relates to the music being played. 

For example, you could have a robot whose eyes get big in response to low frequencies, or a waveform made up of different size cats, or just a nicely stylised graph. 

[Here are some examples](https://ual.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=ec9671f4-61c4-49d9-9f81-b0bc0097dafc) I have done previously from a performance. It shows that using colour, shape, size, location and transparency, you can do a lot with spectral data!

### Submit

1. Your sketch (`.py` file)

2. A short (200 words) written description of 

    * How your sketch works 

    * How well you feel it displays information about audio files. This may include how well it works for different audio files / artists / genres. Include screenshots or videos to support your points
