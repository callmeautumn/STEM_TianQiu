# STEM for Creatives Assignment 2

The task is to design an experiment addressing a research question that pertains to the creative industries that involves working with human participants using one of the recording techniques (sensors, camera inputs etcâ€¦) discussed in the lectures. Your experiment should have at least one control condition and one test condition

Write a experiment plan including the following information (approx 500 words).

1. The research question

2. Method
  
* Apparatus: the physical equipment you will use
  
* Conditions: the independent variables
  
* Measures: the dependent variables you will measure
  
* Procedure: a description of what participants will do in your study

* Participants: how you will recruit your participants, their general demographics (age, gender, occupation), and any other factors important to your study that you will record or analyse.


3. Results
 * What hypotheses will you be testing?
 
 * What plots and statistical tests will you use? (May have to look back to week 4 for this)

4. Discussion
 * Identify possible confounding variables and experimental errors
 
 * Reflect on how you have balanced internal and external validity in your experiment design
 
 * Consider any ethical issues that may arise. How have you accounted for this in your experimental design?
